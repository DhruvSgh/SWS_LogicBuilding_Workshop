Q1. Check whether a number is even or odd
# Program to check for even or odd numbers
 def isEven(n):
    return (n % 2 == 0)
     
n = 101
a = isEven(n)
if a==0:
	print(“Even”)
else
	print(“Odd”)

Q2. check whether a number is prime or not
# Python program to check if given number is prime or not
  num = 11
  
# If given number is greater than 1
if num > 1:
  
    # Iterate from 2 to n / 2
    for i in range(2, int(num/2)+1):
  
        # If num is divisible by any number between
        # 2 and n / 2, it is not prime
        if (num % i) == 0:
            print(num, "is not a prime number")
            break
    else:
        print(num, "is a prime number")
  
else:
    print(num, "is not a prime number")
